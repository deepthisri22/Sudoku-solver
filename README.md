# Sudoku-solver
Sudoku puzzle is a grid of 9x9 squares to be filled in with numbers from 1 to 9. The approach used to solve sudoku puzzles is inspired by inception architecture.The residual network is used along with convolution layers to achieve better performance. Incremental training methodology is adopted to train the whole network having several blocks. This method has proven to be beneficial despite having fewer parameters and computationally less expensive in comparison to a simple CNN model. The main aim of this project is to prove that neural networks have potential for decoding non-linear codes like the sudoku codes.
